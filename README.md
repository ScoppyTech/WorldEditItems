Does it bother you that WorldEdit uses native objects in Minecraft and ruins the gaming experience? This mod is just for you! This mod adds three new items for use with WorldEdit so that you do not have to use vanilla items.

**Requires [WorldEdit](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/worldedit)**

Available for **Fabric** (requires [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api)), **Quilt** (Use the Fabric Version) (requires [Quilt Standard Libraries](https://modrinth.com/mod/qsl)) and **Forge**

## Configuration

1. Check if you have WorldEdit installed (if not the mod is useless)
1. Put the .jar file in your mods folder
1. In game, hold the Wand/NavWand/SuperPickaxe item, and type `/tool selwand` `/tool selwand` (for now, the SuperPickaxe option is not available I think, I will update you soon)
1. After that, try to use the Wand Axe or Nav Wand and see the results

**NOTE**: if Commands i gived are not working, please report this to [WorldEdit Devs](https://github.com/enginehub/worldedit/issues)

## HEY!!!
